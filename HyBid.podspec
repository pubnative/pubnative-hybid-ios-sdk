                     HyBid leverages first-look prebid technology to maximize yield for the publishers across
                     their current monetization suit. Access to the unique demand across different formats allows
                     publishers to immediately benefit with additional revenues on top of their current yield. Prebid technology
                     allows getting a competitive bid before executing your regular waterfall logic, and then
                     participate in the relevant auctions in the cascade.
